# SVN Repository Information #

So the system is setup and ready. Tortoise SVN is a great tool that integrates with your shell to allow easy SVN access. I'd recommend downloading that. If you need help setting it up, let me know. The address to the repository is on the Source tab.


# A Question #

Does anyone know how (or if) this wiki system allows for work ticket creation? Dave wants us to record our time spent on the project, so it would be cool if we could incorporate this into our system instead of writing on paper every time.
